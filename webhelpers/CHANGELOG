WebHelpers ChangeLog

0.6.2 (tip)

0.6.1 (7/31/2008)
* Include a faster version of cgi.escape for use by the literal object.
* Fixed bug in SimplerXMLGenerator that the FeedGenerator uses, so that
  it doesn't use a {} arg.
* New helpers:
  - nl2br() and format_paragraphs() in webhelpers.html.converters.
  - ul() and ol() in webhelpers.html.tags.
  - series() in webhelpers.text.
* HTML.tag() is a synonym for make_tag(), both in webhelpers.html.builder.
* Change default form method to "post" (rather than "POST") to conform to XHTML.
* Add DeprecationWarning for webhelpers.rails package,
  webhelpers.rails.url_for(), and webhelpers.pagination.

0.6 (07/08/2008)
* Add webhelpers.html.builder to generate HTML tags with smart escaping,
  along with a literal type to mark preformatted strings.
* Deprecate webhelpers.rails, including its Javascript libraries (Prototype
  and Scriptaculous).  Wrap all rails helpers in a literal.
* Many new modules:
  constants - countries, states, and provinces.
  containers - high-level collections, including flash messages.
  date - date/time (rails replacement).
  html.converters - text-to-HTML (rails replacement).
  html.tags - HTML tags (rails replacement).
  html.tools - larger HTML chunks (rails replacement).
  mail - sending email.
  misc -  helpers that are neither text, numeric, container, nor date.
  number - numeric helpers and number formatters.
  paginate - successor to deprecated pagination module.
  text - non-HTML text formatting (rails replacement).
* Removed dependency on simplejson and normalized quotes. Patch by Elisha 
  Cook.

COMPATIBILITY CHANGES IN 0.6 DEV VERSION:
- image(), javascript_link(), stylesheet_link(), and auto_discovery_link()
  in webhelpers.html.tags do not add prefixes or suffixes to the URL args
  anymore; they output the exact URL given. Same for button_to() in
  webhelpers.html.tools.
- webhelpers.html.tags.javascript_path was deleted.

0.3.4 (03/18/08)
* Fixed missing javascripts dir.

0.3.3 (02/27/08)
* Fixed strip_unders so that it won't explode during iteration when the size
  changes.
* Updated feedgenerator with the latest changes from Django's version (only
  a few additional attributes).

0.3.2 (09/05/07)
* Added capability to pass pagination a SA 0.4 Session object which will be 
  used for queries. This allows compatibility with Session.mapper'd objects
  and normal SA 0.4 mapper relations.
* Updated SQLAlchemy ORM pagination for SA 0.4 Session.mapper objects.
* Updated Scriptaculous to 1.7.1 beta 3 (1.7.0 is incompatible with Prototype
  1.5.1). Thanks errcw. Fixes #288.

0.3.1 (07/14/07)
* Added the secure_form_tag helper module, for generating form tags
  including client-specific authorization tokens for preventing CSRF
  attacks. Original patch by David Turner. Fixes #157.
* current_url now accepts arguments to pass along to url_for. Fixes #251.
* Updated prototype to 1.5.1.1.
* Added image support to button_to. Patch by Alex Conrad. Fixes #184.
* Fix radio_button and submit_to_remote not handling unicode values.
  Fixes #235.
* Added support for the defer attribute to javascript_include_tag. Suggested
  by s0undt3ch. Fixes #214.
* Added a distutils command compress_resources, which can combine CSS
  and Javascript files, and compress Javascript via ShrinkSafe.  Add
  "command_packages=webhelpers.commands" in [global] in setup.cfg to
  enable this command for your package.

0.3 (03/18/2007)
* WARNING: paginate now takes arguments intended for the collection object as
  query_args. This could affect backwards compatibility. This fixes a common
  issue that non-keyword arguments passed into paginate get eaten by
  paginate's keyword arguments instead of being in *args to go on to the
  collection.
* Added environ checking with Routes so that page will be automatically pulled
  out of the query string, or from the Routes match dict if available.
* Added ability for paginate to check for objects that had SQLAlchemy's 
  assign_mapper applied to them.
* Added better range checking to paginator to require a positive value that is
  less than the total amount of pages available for a page.
* WARNING: Due to a typo, the Text helper highlight function no longer
  highlights text with the CSS class name 'hilight' by default: it now uses
  the CSS class name 'highlight' instead. The function's 'hilighter' keyword
  argument has also been deprecated, use 'highlighter' instead.
* Fixed the broken markdown function.
* Upgraded markdown from 1.5 to 1.6a.
* Sync'd Prototype helper to 6057.

  Python 2.5 and beyond. Reported by anilj. Fixes #190.
* Applied patch from David Smith to decode URL parts as Routes does.
  Fixes #186.
* Changed pagination to give better response if its passed an invalid object.
  Patch from Christoph Haas.
* Fixed scriptaculous helper docs example. Fixes #178.
* Updated scriptaculous/prototype to Prototype 1.5.0 and Scriptaculous 1.7.0.
* Updated scriptaculous javascripts to 1.6.5. Fixes #155.
* Updated remote_function doc-string to more clearly indicate the arguments
  it can receive.
* Synced Rails Javascript helper to 5245 (escape_javascript now escaping
  backslashes and allow passing html_options to javascript_tag).

0.2.2 (10/20/06)
* Fixed tag_options function to not str() string and let html_escape handle
  it so unicode is properly handled. Reported with fix by Michael G. Noll.
* Added sqlalchemy.Query support to the pagination orm wrappers, patch from
  Andrija ZariÄ‡

  Jamie Wilkinson)

* More precise distance_of_time_in_words (Follows bottom half of #4989 Rails
  changeset)
* button_to accepts method keyword so you can PUT and DELETE with it. 
  (Follows #4914 Rails changeset)

  argument.
* Sync'd scriptaculous helper.
* Sync'd javascript, prototype helpers and prototype.js to latest Rails
