WebHelpers
++++++++++++

WebHelpers is package aimed at providing helper functions for use within web applications.

These functions are intended to ease web development with template languages by removing common view logic and
encapsulating it in re-usable modules as well as occasionally providing objects for use within controllers to
assist with common web development paradigms.

For support/question/patches, please use the `Pylons mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-discuss>`_.

*Requirements:* Some WebHelper functions require `Routes <http://routes.groovie.org/>`_ to be active in the
framework for a variety of functions. Currently `Pylons <http://pylons.groovie.org/>`_, `TurboGears <http://trac.turbogears.org/turbogears/wiki/RoutesIntegration>`_,
and `Aquarium <http://aquarium.sourceforge.net/>`_ support Routes.
