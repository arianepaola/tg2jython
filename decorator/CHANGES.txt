2.2.0. Added a note on 'inspect.getsource' not working for decorated

     documentation with pygments; slightly simplified the code (31/07/2007)
2.1.0. Replaced the utility 'update_wrapper' with 'new_wrapper' and
     updated the documentation accordingly; fixed and improved the 
     doctester argument parsing, signaled by Sam Wyse (3/07/2007)
2.0.1. Included the licence in the source code too; fixed a versioning
     issue by adding the version number to the zip file and fixing
     the link to it on the web page, thanks to Philip Jenvey (17/02/2007)
2.0. Rewritten and simplified the implementation; broken compatibility
     with previous versions (see README.txt); added the utility function
     'update_wrapper' instead of 'newfunc' (13/01/2007)
1.1. 'decorator' instances now have attributes __name__, __doc__,
     __module__ and __dict__ coming from the associated caller function;
