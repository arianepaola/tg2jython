Things TO-DO before 1.0 is released:

* Documentation, specially in the format of easily digested tutorials for
  tw.forms, is badly needed. 

  We would *really* appreciate any help in this area. Please drop a line at
  toscawidgets-discuss Google group if you want to lend a hand.

* Remove some miscelaneous cruft, feeders.py comes to mind...

That's about all.
