Making a Movies database
===========================================

Let's get started by creating a simple project using quickstart::
  
  paster quickstart movies

Getting Started
---------------------

Your first step to creating your model in TurboGears with SQLALchemy is to 
edit your model/__init__.py :

.. code-block: python 
  :linenos:

  from pylons import config
  from sqlalchemy import Column, MetaData, Table, types
  from sqlalchemy.orm import mapper, relation
  from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker

  # Global session manager.  Session() returns the session object
  # appropriate for the current web request.
  DBSession = scoped_session(sessionmaker(autoflush=True, transactional=True))

  # Global metadata. If you have multiple databases with overlapping table
  # names, you'll need a metadata for each database.
  metadata = MetaData()
  
  def init_model(engine):
      """Call me before using any of the tables or classes in the model."""
      # Reflected tables must be defined and mapped here.

  # Normal tables may be defined and mapped at module level, or here:

  # Create a table
  movie_table = Table("movie", metadata,
      Column("id", types.Integer, primary_key=True),
      Column("title", types.String(100), nullable=False),
      Column("year", types.Integer, nullable=False),
      Column("description", types.String(256), nullable=True),
      )


  # Define ORM classes (often called "mapped classes").
  # attributes will be added by the mapper below
  class Movie(object):
      pass

  # Map each class to its corresponding table.
  mapper(Movie, movie_table)

Auto-reflection of tables has to happen after all the configuration is read, 
and the app is setup, so we provide simple init_model method that is not 
called until after everything is setup for you.  

But, that's not what we're doing here.  We've just defined a new SQLAlchemy 
table object `movie_table` which we can use to generate the database schema for 
us.  

There are times when you want to introspect your SQLAlchemy tables from the 
database, rather than defining them in python, but when you're starting a new 
project it's nice to define the tables in python, and take advantage of the fact 
that SQLAlchemy can generate schemas for a wide variety of databases.   
Effectively you can get database independence for your project for free.  

If you're defining your tables in Python, you'll want to get familiar with the 
basics of the SQLAlchemy Types system, so you know what datatypes you can use 
in your columns. 

Types
--------

SQLAlchemy provides a number of built-in types which it automatically maps to underling database types.  If you want the latest and greatest listing just type:

.. code-block: python

  >>> from sqlalchemy import types
  >>> dir(types)

main types are:

================ ========
 type            value    
================ ========
 types.Binary    binary   
 types.Boolean   boolean  
 types.Integer   integer  
 types.Numeric   number   
 types.String    string   
 types.Date      date     
 types.Time      time     
 types.DateTime  datetime 
================ ========

There are also two properties that apply to all column objects, which you 
might want to set up front. 

Properties
-----------

============  ==========
 property     value      
============  ==========
 primary_key  True/False 
 nullable     True/False 
============  ==========

Pretty much these do exactly what you would expect them to do, set a field to 
be a primary key or set it to accept null values.  Both are false by default. 

Object Relational Mapping
-----------------------------

Once you've got a table, such as the movie_table we're using in this example 
you can create a Movie class to support a more object oriented way of looking 
at your data::

  class Movie(object):
      def __init__(self, title, year, description, **kw):
          self.title = title
          self.year = year
          self.description = description
    
      def __repr__(self):
          return "<Movie('%s','%s', '%s')>" % (self.title, self.year, self.description)


If you're following along with the tutorial, you'll want to make sure you 
custom __init__ method.  We'll use this to create new Movie instances, and set 
their data all at once throughout the rest of the tutorial. 


If you don't define the __init__ method. You will need to update the properties 
of a movie object after it's been created like this::

  >>> entry = Movie()
  >>> entry.title = 'Dragula'
  >>> entry.year = '1931'
  >>> entry.description = 'vampire movie'

But if the __init__ method we defined allows you to initialize the properties 
at the same time you create the object::

  >>> entry = Movie(title='Drakula', year='1931', description='vampire movie')

or ::

  >>> entry = Movie('Drakula', '1931', 'vampire movie')

Bootstrapping the application with CRUD
========================================


There are 2 options for building the controllers to use your model, build it 
yourself using the ORM, or generate a basic interface automatically using CRUD.


Use ORM
---------

Edit controllers/root.py::

    from movies.lib.base import BaseController
    from tg import expose, flash
    from movies.model import DBSession, Movie

    class RootController(BaseController):

        ### Removed code for brevity

        @expose('movies.templates.index')
        def show(self):
            flash("create model")

            # create entry
            entry = Movie("Transformer", 2007, "Cars and robots")          
            # create entry if not define model object __init__ method
            #entry = Movie()
            #entry.title="Transformer"
            #entry.year=2007
            #entry.description ="Cars and robots"


            # save entry
            DBSession.save(entry)
            DBSession.commit()

            # query record from Movie object record = DBSession.query(Movie).filter(Movie.title=='Transformer').one()

            return dict(record=record.title)


Edit template/index.html and add::

  <h1 py:replace="record">record</h1>


Use CRUD tool
--------------

You could use paster command to create a customizable interface to Create, 
Read, Update, Delete records 

(CRUD) based on model ::

    $ paster crud
    
Note: Make sure you have created your models first

    Enter the model name: Movie
    Enter the primary key [id]: 
    Enter the package name [MovieController]:
    Enter the model form name [MovieForm]: 

or use short command without prompt::

$ paster crud -i id Movie MovieController

The command Create several files

* controllers/MovieController.py
* controllers/MovieForm.py
* templates/MovieController/list.html
* templates/MovieController/show.html
* templates/MovieController/form.html

Edit controllers/root.py::

    ### Other code goes here
 
    from MovieController import MovieController

    class RootController(BaseController):
        movie = MovieController()

        @expose('www.templates.index')
        def index(self):
            from datetime import datetime
            flash("Your application is now running")
            return dict(now=datetime.now())

Browse http://localhost:8080/movie/ and you got an Movie model admin interface. Note that the trailing '/' is important here.

Edit MovieForm.py to customize the field corresponding to your model. 

And edit list.html/show.html to decide which column you want to show.
