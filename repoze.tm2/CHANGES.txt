repoze.tm2 1.0a3

 Allow ``commit_veto`` hook to be specified within Paste config, ala::

   [filter:tm]
   use = repoze.tm:make_tm
   commit_veto = some.package:myfunction

 ``myfunction`` should take three args: environ, status, headers and
 should return True if the txn should be aborted, False if it should
 be committed.

repoze.tm2 1.0a2 (2008/7/15)

 Provide "commit_veto" hook point (contributed by Alberto Valverde).

 Point easy_install at http://dist.repoze.org/tm2/dev/simple via setup.cfg.
 
repoze.tm2 1.0a1:

 Fork point: we've created repoze.tm2, which is repoze.tm that has a
 dependency only on the 'transaction' package instead of all of ZODB.

 Better documentation for non-Zope usage in README.txt.

repoze.tm 0.8

 Relaxed requirement for ZODB 3.7.2, since we might need to use
 the package with other verions.  Note that the tests which depend
 on transaction having "doom" semantics don't work with 3.7.2, anyway.

repoze.tm 0.7

 Depend on PyPI release of ZODB 3.7.2.  Upgrade to this by doing
 bin/easy_install -U 'ZODB3 >= 3.7.1, < 3.8.0a' if necessary.

repoze.tm 0.6

 after_end.register and after_end.unregister must now be passed a
 transaction object rather than a WSGI environment to avoid the
 possibility that the WSGI environment used by a child participating
 in transaction management won't be the same one used by the repoze.tm
 package.

 repoze.tm now inserts a key into the WSGI environment
 ('repoze.tm.active') if it's active in the WSGI pipeline.  An API
 function, repoze.tm:isActive can be called with a single argument,
 the WSGI environment, to check if the middleware is active.

repoze.tm 0.5

 Depend on rerolled ZODB 3.7.1 instead of zopelib.

 Add license and copyright, change trove classifiers.

repoze.tm 0.4

 Depend on zopelib rather than ZODB 3.8.0b3 distribution, because the
 ZODB distribution pulls in various packages (zope.interface and ZEO
 most notably) that are incompatible with stock Zope 2.10.4 apps and
 older sandboxes.  We'll need to revisit this.

repoze.tm 0.3

 Provide limited compatibility for older transaction package versions
 which don't support the 'transaction.isDoomed' API.

repoze.tm 0.2

 Provide after_end API for registering callbacks at transaction end.

repoze.tm 0.1
