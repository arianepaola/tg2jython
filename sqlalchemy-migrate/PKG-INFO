Description: 
        Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations, Migrate provides a way to deal with database schema changes in `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.org>`_ projects.
        
        Migrate extends SQLAlchemy to have database changeset handling. It provides a database change repository mechanism which can be used from the command line as well as from inside python code.
