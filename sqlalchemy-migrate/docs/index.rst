SQLAlchemy Migrate
==================
SQLAlchemy schema change management
-----------------------------------

Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations, SQLAlchemy Migrate provides a way to deal with database schema changes in SQLAlchemy_ projects.

Migrate was started as part of `Google's Summer of Code`_ by Evan Rosson, mentored by Jonathan LaCour.

The project was taken over by a small group of volunteers when Evan had no free time for the project. It is now hosted as a `Google Code project`_. During the hosting change the project was renamed to SQLAlchemy Migrate.
