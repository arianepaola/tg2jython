tw.forms Changelog
==================

0.9.2 (unreleased)
-------------------
* Removed fieldfactory.py since it depends on RuleDispatch which we no longer
  depend on and wasn't actively maintained. If you still need it you can grab
  it form earlier revisions in the repository.
* Reverted EGG to being zip-unsafe since mako templates cannot be located
  otherwise.

* :class:`tw.forms.InputWidget` now has a ``strip_name`` parameter which can
  be set to True to indicate that the name if this field (which **must** have
  children) will not be used to build fully-qualified names.
  This is useful to "flatten-out" nested fieldsets which otheriwise would
  need/provide a nested dict.
* Removed the ``strip_name_if_root_container`` since it is redundant now what
  there is a ``strip_name`` parameter.

0.9.1 (Jun, 8 2008)
-------------------

* Made tw.forms EGG zip safe now that TW can serve static resources from inside
  zipped EGGS

  Pauli Virtanen.
* There's a new ``SecureFormMixin`` to protect against CSRF attacks, thanks to
