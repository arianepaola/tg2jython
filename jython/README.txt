Welcome to Jython 2.5b3
=======================

This is the forth beta of the 2.5 version of Jython. It contains a couple of
bug fixes since the 2.5b2 release a couple of days ago.  The bug that prompted
another release was a corner case on Windows that caused Jython to not start.
This beta contains all of the new features for the eventual 2.5 release and
represents a feature freeze.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 and requires JDK 5 to run.

As a beta release, this release is incomplete and contains bugs.  Do not
use in a production environment.
