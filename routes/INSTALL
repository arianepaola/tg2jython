Installing Routes can be done the traditional way with:

    python setup.py install

Or directly from the CheeseShop via setuptools:

    easy_install Routes

Alternatively, you can copy the package to your site-packages directory
to bypass the setuptools based install script (which requires an Internet
connection).
