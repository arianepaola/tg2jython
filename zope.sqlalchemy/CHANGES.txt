Changes
=======

0.3 (2008-07-29)
----------------

Bugs fixed:

* New objects added to a session did not cause a transaction join, so were not
  committed at the end of the transaction unless the database was accessed.
  SQLAlchemy 0.4.7 or 0.5beta3 now required.

Feature changes:

* For correctness and consistency with ZODB, renamed the function 'invalidate' 
  to 'mark_changed' and the status 'invalidated' to 'changed'.

0.2 (2008-06-28)
----------------

Feature changes:

* Updated to support SQLAlchemy 0.5. (0.4.6 is still supported).

0.1 (2008-05-15)
----------------

* Initial public release.
