Description: ============
        Transactions
        ============
        
        This package contains a generic transaction implementation for Python. It is
        mainly used by the ZODB, though.
        
        Note that the data manager API, ``transaction.interfaces.IDataManager``,
        is syntactically simple, but semantically complex.  The semantics
        were not easy to express in the interface. This could probably use
        more work.  The semantics are presented in detail through examples of
        a sample data manager in ``transaction.tests.test_SampleDataManager``.

        * Initial release, branched from ZODB trunk on 2007-11-08 (aka
        "3.9.0dev").
        
        * Remove (deprecated) support for beforeCommitHook alias to
        addBeforeCommitHook.
        
        * Add weakset tests.
        
        * Remove unit tests that depend on ZODB.tests.utils from
        test_transaction (these are actually integration tests).
